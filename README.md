# say-my-name

Implement the function `sayMyName()` that will return a string `Hi! My name is <firstName> <lastName>`.
  
*NOTE*: The function `sayMyName()` will be called with different inputs, such as `sayMyName('A', 'B')` or even empty strings like `sayMyName('', '')` so do not hard code the string. Think of the parameters `firstName` and `lastName` as some variables that contain any strings. Do not overthink this assignment. You just need to concatenate strings together.
